## Code Quality Standards

Before submitting a Pull Request, verify that your code conforms to these standards:

1. **TypeScript Strictness**: Write strictly typed code. Avoid using `any` and verify type definitions. Validate your changes pass TypeScript compilation:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```
2. **Styling and Layout**: We use Tailwind CSS v4 and `uniwind` for universal styling. Please leverage the existing layout utility tokens and spacing variables to maintain visual consistency.
3. **Cross-Platform Verification**: Verify that your interface looks correct and functions properly on both iOS and Android.

## Pull Request Submission

### Submission Checklist

1. Create a focused feature branch from the latest default branch.
2. Ensure your changes address a single feature or bug fix to simplify review.
3. Verify that the TypeScript compilation passes successfully.
4. Provide a clear description of the modification in the Pull Request, attaching screenshots or screen recordings for UI-related changes.

### AI Usage Guidelines

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you used generative AI tools (such as Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, or similar services) to assist in writing, refactoring, or documenting your code contribution, you must disclose this usage in your
> Pull Request description.

Please state:

* Which AI tools were utilized.
* The specific scope of their assistance (e.g., "AI assisted with writing TypeScript definitions", "Used Claude to generate helper utility functions", or "Used Cursor to help build the UI layout").

All contributors are fully responsible for the correctness, stability, and security of their submitted code, regardless of whether AI tools were used. All code must be validated and tested before
submission.
