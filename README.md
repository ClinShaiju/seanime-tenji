## Development

Seanime Tenji is built with React Native and Expo. Detailed guides on setup and local development workflows can be found in the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Metro Bundler**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:start
   ```

3. **Run on Emulator / Simulator**:
	* **Android**:
	  ```bash
	  npx expo run:android
	  ```
	* **iOS**:
	  ```bash
	  npm run dev:ios
	  ```

### Local Build & Development Notes

When building and testing Seanime Tenji locally, keep these integration requirements in mind:

* **Physical iOS Devices & Signing**: To test on a physical iOS device, configure your Apple Developer Team ID inside a `.env.local` file at the root:
  ```env
  EXPO_APPLE_TEAM_ID=YOUR_TEAM_ID
  ```

* **Libmpv Integration (Android)**: The application uses a custom Expo config plugin (`plugins/withLibcppPickFirst.js`) to merge library symbols required by `libmpv.so` (the video player engine).
  Running a standard prebuild (`npx expo prebuild`) handles this configuration automatically.

* **Hermes and JS Proxies**: To prevent the Hermes engine from throwing `native state unsupported` exceptions, the custom player modules are wrapped in plain JavaScript objects rather than JS Proxy
  objects.
